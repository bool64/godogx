## Pretty Failed Formatter

When running a bit test suite, where most of the scenarios pass, the output becomes less helpful if you try to check the
failing scenarios.

`pretty-failed` formatter extends `pretty` formatter, but discards output of successful scenarios and also does not show
skipped steps after the failure was encountered.

You can enable it by calling `godogx.RegisterPrettyFailedFormatter()`.
